# Codex World Explorer

This repository contains a small 3D canvas demo used for the Codex Game GitHub Pages site.
The demo now renders a natural landscape in 3D with a river and mountains.
Only the water surface is animated while the rest of the scene stays mostly static.
A whale glides across the water and several small fish swim around it.
